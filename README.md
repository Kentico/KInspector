**Kentico Inspector** (formerly KInspector) is an application for analyzing the health, performance and security of **[Kentico EMS](https://www.kentico.com/)** solutions.

Kentico Inspector was initially developed as an internal application by the Kentico consulting team to help evaluation customer's web sites. We quickly realized that the broader community would benefit from this as well, so we made it open source.

The application is Kentico version agnostic and has no dependencies on version-specific DLLs. Most modules are designed to support version 10 and later, but some will work on older versions as well.

## Get the application

### Introduction to V4

Version 4 is a complete rewrite of the tool. We wanted to create a better, more flexible codebase for both the front and back ends.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Kentico/KInspector/releases/latest).

> :warning: V4 is currently ALPHA and we're still porting reports.
>
> If you need a report that hasn't been migrated yet, please use [the latest release of V3](https://github.com/Kentico/KInspector/releases) or consider porting it and submitting a PR!

### Running the tool

The application supports two modes currently: console and IIS. Console mode is useful if you just want to quickly run the tool occasionally, whereas IIS mode allows you to have it always available, for example, on a development server. In either case you need to extract the entire package in a folder.

> The application needs permission to create/modify files in the directory it is run from to save instances to a file.

#### Console Mode

To run in console mode simply run `KenticoInspector.WebApplication.exe` and open your browser to either https://localhost:5001 or http://localhost:5000.

#### IIS Mode

To run in IIS  mode point your IIS directory to the folder you extracted everything to and make sure the application pool's .NET CLR version is set to `No managed code`. Open the site in your browser.

## Development Requirements

All versions below are from a known working environment. Lower versions may work but are not tested.

- [Visual Studio 2017 updated to 15.9.11 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
- [Node for Windows (10.15.X+)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM (6.4.X+) (included with Node)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Vue CLI (3.x)](https://cli.vuejs.org/)

### First run

Even if you don't plan to make any changes in the Client UI application, you'll need to build it before your first run and any time the client code is updated. To build the Client UI application (required anytime the client UI code is updated unless you are using the `UI Development` debug launch setting):

#### Frontend build instructions
1. Open Powershell/Command Prompt
1. Change the directory to `./KenticoInspector.WebApplication/ClientApp`
1. Run `npm i`
1. Run `npm run build`

#### Backend build instructions

1. Open `KInspector.sln` in Visual Studio
1. Do a build
1. Make sure the `KenticoInspector.WebApplication` project is the start up project
1. You can run it with either the `IIS Express` or `Console` debug launch settings

If you want to work on the Client UI application, there's a few additional steps to go through.

1. Open the `./KenticoInspector.WebApplication/ClientApp` directory in your editor of choice (Visual Studio Code is recommended) as well as in Powershell
1. In Powershell, run `npm i` (if you haven't yet) and `npm run serve`
1. Leave the application is running.
1. Follow the steps to build the backend, but run it using the `UI Development` debug launch settings.
   - This runs the backend with a proxy to the running instance you started in Powershell and allows you to take advantage of the hot-reloading of the client application
