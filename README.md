## History

Kentico Inspector was initially developed as an internal tool by the Kentico Consulting team to help evaluate customers' Kentico solutions. We quickly realized that the broader community would benefit from this as well, so we made it open source.

The application is Kentico-version-agnostic and has no dependencies on version-specific DLLs. Most modules are designed to support version 10 and later, but some will work on older versions as well.

## Introduction to Version 4

Version 4 is a complete rewrite of the tool in .NET Core and Vue. We wanted to create a better, more flexible codebase for both the front and back ends.

Version 4 is currently **ALPHA**:

- Not all reports are migrated.
- Some reports may still be revised to show more useful results.
- Core functionality is being added and internal API may change without notice.

If you need a report that hasn't been migrated yet, please use [the last release of V3](https://github.com/Kentico/KInspector/releases) or consider migrating it and submitting a pull request!
