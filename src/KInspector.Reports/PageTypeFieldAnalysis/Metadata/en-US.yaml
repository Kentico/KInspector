  name: Page type field analysis
  shortDescription: Checks for cases where two or more page types have a field with the same name but mismatched data types
  longDescription: |
    This report shows fields with duplicated names, their SQL data types, and their associated page types.
    
    Two or more page types with fields with the same name, but different data types, cause several issues within kentico, not limited to the following:
    - Exporting/importing a site 
    - Working with web parts or widgets that list more than one page type
    
    The best way to fix this issue is to prepend the page type code name to the field name: `CustomPageTypeA_FieldName`.
