# Ways to contribute 
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/PYTV0jP.png">

There are many different ways in which you can contribute. One of the easiest ways is simply to use our software and provide us with your feedback through the right channel. You can also help us improve the open-source projects by submitting pull requests with code and documentation changes.

## Where to get support
Please note that **level of provided support is always determined by the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)** of a given open-source project. Also, always make sure you use the **[latest version](../../releases)** of any given OS project. We can't provide any help for older versions. We don't want to make things complicated so we try to take the same approach in all our repositories. 

### I found a bug in a Kentico's open-source project
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/TYIQdpv.png">

Sorry to hear that. Just log a new [GitHub issue](../../issues) and someone will take a look at it. Remember, the more information you provide, the easier it will be to fix the issue. If you feel like it, you can also fix the bug on your own and submit a new pull request.

### I need help with using the projects and/or coding
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/company/img/logos/so/so-icon.svg">

To get help with coding and structuring your projects, use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to ask questions with one of the following tags:
- [`kentico-cloud`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kentico-cloud)
- [`kentico`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kentico)

Our team members and the community monitor these channels on a regular basis.

### I want to report a security bug
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/z82nnJB.png">

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Kentico Developer Community Team developerscommunity@kentico.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.


### I have an idea for a new feature (or feedback on existing functionality)
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/rUFkyPy.png">

Everybody loves new features! You can submit a new [feature request](../../issues) or you can code it on your own and [send us a pull request](#submitting-pull-requests). In either case, don't forget to mention what's the use case and what's the expected output.


## Submitting pull requests
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/aSeiliy.png">

Unless you're fixing a typo, it's usually a good idea to discuss the feature before you submit a pull request with code changes, so let's start with submitting a new [GitHub issue](../../issues) and discussing the whether it fits the vision of a given project.
You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Kentico Maintainers teams, and only those that meet an high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.


### Example - process of contribution
If not stated otherwise, we use [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). 

To start with coding, fork the repository you want to contribute to, create a new branch, and start coding. Once the functionality is [done](#Definition-of-Done), you can submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). 

### Definition of Done
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/g82Ohdv.png">

- New/fixed code is covered with tests
- CI can build the code
- All tests are pass
- New version number follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Coding style (spaces, indentation) is in line with the rest of the code in a given repository
- Documentation is updated (e.g. code examples in README, Wiki pages, etc.)
- All `public` members are documented (using XML doc, phpdoc, etc.)
- Code doesn't contain any secrets (private keys, etc.)
- Commit messages are clear. Please read these articles: [Writing good commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages), [A Note About Git Commit Messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), [On commit messages](https://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html)


### Feedback
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZQfNzJJ.png">

Your pull request will now go through extensive checks by the subject matter experts on our team. Please be patient. Update your pull request according to feedback until it is approved by one of the Kentico maintainers. After that, one of our team members may adjust the branch you merge into based on the expected release schedule.
