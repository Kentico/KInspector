      cMSRenewSessionAuthChange: "Consider enabling session renewal, to enforce user session disposal: [Avoiding session fixation](https://docs.kentico.com/k12sp/securing-websites/designing-secure-websites/securing-and-protecting-the-system/session-protection#Sessionprotection-Avoidingsessionfixation)."
      cMSXFrameOptionsExcluded: "Click jacking protection is disabled for these paths. For more, see [Clickjacking protection](https://docs.kentico.com/k12sp/securing-websites/designing-secure-websites/securing-and-protecting-the-system/clickjacking-protection)."
    connectionStrings:
      saUser: Use integrated security or a specific user.
    settingsKeys:
      cMSAutocompleteEnableForLogin: Enabled autocomplete could be exploited by a physical agent.

      cMSChatEnableFloodProtection: "If the chat feature is used, we recommend enabling flood protection."
      cMSFloodProtectionEnabled: "If the blog or forums features are used, we recommend enabling flood protection."
      cMSForumAttachmentExtensions: "Check for possible dangerous extensions (.exe, .src, ...)."
      cMSMaximumInvalidLogonAttempts: We recommend a reasonable limit to invalid logon attempts.
      cMSMediaFileAllowedExtensions: "Check for possible dangerous extensions (.exe, .src, ...)."
      cMSPasswordExpiration: We recommend enabling password expiration.
      cMSPasswordExpirationBehaviour: We recommend locking the account when the password is expired.
      cMSPasswordFormat: "The most secure password format is `PBKDF2`.For more, see [Setting the user password format](https://docs.kentico.com/k12sp/securing-websites/designing-secure-websites/securing-user-accounts-and-passwords/setting-the-user-password-format)."
      cMSPolicyMinimalLength: A secure number of characters prevents brute force attacks.
      cMSPolicyNumberOfNonAlphaNumChars: A secure number of special characters prevents brute force attacks.
      cMSRegistrationEmailConfirmation: We recommend enabling registration email confirmation.
      cMSResetPasswordInterval: We recommend setting this to no more than half a day.
      cMSRESTServiceEnabled: "There are known security flaws in the REST service. We recommend implementing Web API instead: [Using ASP.NET Web API with Kentico](https://docs.kentico.com/k12sp/integrating-3rd-party-systems/using-asp-net-web-api-with-kentico)."
      cMSUploadExtensions: "Check for possible dangerous extensions (.exe, .src, ...)."
      cMSUsePasswordPolicy: We recommend enabling and configuring the password policy.
      cMSUseSSLForAdministrationInterface: We recommend enabling SSL for the admin interface unless you have SSL enforced in another way.
