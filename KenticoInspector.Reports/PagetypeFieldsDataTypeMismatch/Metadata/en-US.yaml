  name: Page type fields data type mismatch
  shortDescription: Checks for cases where two or more page types have a field with the same name but mismatched data types
  longDescription: |
    When two or more page types have a field with the same name, but mismatched data types it can cause several issues with the CMS.
    For example, when exporting/importing a site or when working with web parts / widgets that list more than one page type you may receive errors.
    The best way to fix this issue is to use the page type code name as the field name prefix. For example: CustomPageTypeA_FieldName
