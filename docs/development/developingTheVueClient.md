# Developing the Vue client

The following steps should get you started with developing the Vue client:

1. Open `.\KenticoInspector.WebApplication\ClientApp` directory in Visual Studio Code or a terminal.
1. Run `npm run serve`.
1. Leave the application running.
1. Open `.\KInspector.sln` in Visual Studio.
1. Select the `UI Development` debug target.
1. Start a debug session (F5). This runs the backend with a proxy to the running client server and allows hot-reloading of the client application.

Now, you can make any changes to the Vue files and on saving they will be recompiled.
