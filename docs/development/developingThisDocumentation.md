# Developing this documentation

The following steps should get you started with developing this documentation:

1. Follow the steps in [Installation via RubyInstaller](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/#installation-via-rubyinstaller).
1. Open `.\docs` in Visual Studio Code or a terminal.
1. Run `bundle install`.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
1. The server URL will be shown. The server will automatically rebuild on file changes. If you need to modify `./docs/_config.yml`, you will need to restart the server with the same command.
